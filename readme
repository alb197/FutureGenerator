This is a future predicting game. 
A user is prompted to enter two items into different categories which 
describe their future life.
The categories are:
	Person they to marry
	Place they want to live
	Number of kids that they wish to pop out
	Type of car that they want to drive
	Type of living situation
	Type of pets they want to adopt
	
The user is then prompted to enter one item per category that they 
would not prefer in their future.

With a random number generator, a counter is generated. The counter
iterates through items in each category and eliminates one item
each iteration. The final items remaining in each category are the
predictions of the user's future.
